- View milestone progress
- Share campaign

### Page 4: Milestone Submission *(New)*

**Purpose:** Allows the startup founder to formally submit proof of milestone completion, triggering the admin verification process. Only accessible to the campaign owner.

**Access Control:**
- Page is only reachable if the connected wallet matches the campaign's registered owner address
- If an unauthorized wallet attempts to access this route directly, they are redirected to the Campaign Detail page with an access-denied notice

**Main Sections / Components:**
- Campaign header (name, current funding status)
- Current milestone context panel: which milestone is being submitted, its description, and the unlock amount tied to it
- Submission form:
  - Milestone completion summary (text field)
  - Supporting evidence or notes (text field)
  - Optional link to external proof (URL field)
- Submission preview / review summary
- Submit for Verification button
- Submission status notice (e.g. "Awaiting admin review") after submission

**Key User Actions:**
- Review which milestone is up for submission
- Fill in completion details and evidence
- Submit milestone for admin review
- View confirmation that submission has been received

---

### Page 5: Admin / Milestone Verification

**Purpose:** Allows an authorized admin to review founder milestone submissions and approve fund releases. Strictly access-gated.

**Access Control:**
- Page is only surfaced in the UI (linked, visible in nav or campaign page) if the connected wallet matches a pre-defined admin address
- Unauthorized wallets attempting direct URL access are redirected to the Campaign Detail page with an access-denied notice
- The link to this page on the Campaign Detail page is conditionally rendered — it does not appear for non-admin wallets

**Main Sections / Components:**
- Campaign header with current escrow balance displayed
- Milestone list with status for each (pending / submitted / verified / released)
- Selected milestone detail view:
  - Milestone description
  - Founder's submitted proof and notes
  - External proof link (if provided)
  - Unlock amount
  - Current status
- Approve / Reject action controls
- Rejection reason input field (shown if rejecting)
- Funds release confirmation prompt (shown after approval)
- Verification history log: past decisions with wallet address and timestamps

**Key User Actions:**
- Select a submitted milestone to review
- Review founder-submitted proof
- Approve or reject a milestone
- Provide a rejection reason for the founder
- Trigger fund release after approval
- View full verification audit history

---

### Page 6: User Dashboard

**Purpose:** Personal hub for any connected user — both supporters tracking investments and founders tracking campaigns.

**Main Sections / Components:**
- Profile header: wallet address, total invested, campaigns supported
- "My Investments" tab: list of campaigns invested in, tokens held per campaign, current milestone status per campaign
- "My Campaigns" tab (for founders): list of campaigns created, funding status, pending milestone actions, quick link to submit a milestone
- Token portfolio summary: all tokens held across campaigns
- Quick-action links to each campaign's detail page, milestone submission page, or admin panel

**Key User Actions:**
- Switch between supporter and founder views
- Navigate to a specific campaign
- Track milestone progress across all investments
- Navigate directly to Milestone Submission from a campaign row

---

### Global Component: Connect Wallet (Modal / Overlay)

**Purpose:** Prompts the user to connect their crypto wallet before performing any on-chain action. This is a global UI component, not a page — it can be triggered from anywhere in the application without navigating away.

**Main Sections / Components:**
- Modal overlay
- Brief explanation of why connection is needed
- Wallet option list
- Cancel / close option

**Key User Actions:**
- Select and connect a wallet
- Dismiss modal and return to current page

[Connect Wallet Modal]
↑ Triggered from: any page requiring a wallet action
↓ On success: returns user to the originating page and action — no redirect
```

**Key Navigation Principles:**
- The global nav bar is persistent across all pages: Home, Create Campaign, User Dashboard, and the wallet connect control are always accessible.
- Token purchase no longer leaves the Campaign Detail page — it resolves inline, keeping the user in context.
- Milestone Submission and Admin Panel are both conditionally surfaced — they only appear as options when the connected wallet has the appropriate role.
- Unauthorized direct URL access to gated pages redirects to Campaign Detail, not a blank error screen, keeping the user in a useful state.
- After campaign creation, founders land directly on their new Campaign Detail page.
- The Connect Wallet modal never triggers a page navigation — it always resolves in place.
